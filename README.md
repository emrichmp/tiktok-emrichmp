## Technologies

In this React app I only used these 4 modern frontend technologies...

<code><a href="https://reactjs.org/"><img width="10%" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/reactjs/reactjs-ar21.svg"></a></code>
<code><a href="https://firebase.google.com/"><img width="10%" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/firebase/firebase-ar21.svg"></a></code>
<code><a href="https://fontawesome.com/"><img width="10%" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/font-awesome/font-awesome-ar21.svg"></a></code>
<code><a href="https://mui.com/"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/M/material-ui-logo-5BDCB9BA8F-seeklogo.com.png" width="60"></a></code>

## Future Plans?

I have some of the future plans for the app listed above for v3 and v4 however, I would love to add a fully working user system using oauth! oauth is that nifty software you can use so that a user can sign in with google or facebook! In addition I would love to expand on the firebase backend and "beef it up" a bit more by adding more attributes to the tiktoks such as hashtags! Most importantly at the moment I would love to style the TikTok attributes a bit more and make comments interactive! I'll keep you guys posted!

## Installation
if you want to experiment with this app or run it locally fork and clone this repo.
1. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies.
2. Run ```npm start``` to start server.
3. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000"
*you shouldn't need to do anything for the firebase backend to work, however if you are experiencing any trouble please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emrich-michael-perrier/) to let me know!*
